- Dataset Description:
  This dataset contains information about students such as attendance, study hours, previous grades, and parental support.

- Type of Data:
  Structured (Table Data)

- ML Concept:
  Machine Learning – predicting student final grades.

- Problem Statement (the main question is) :
  Can we predict a student’s final grade based on attendance, study hours, and previous performance?

- Prediction / Output:
  Final Grade of the student.    Eg: Student studies more -> higher grade
                                     Student studies less -> lower grade

- What we learned:
 - Higher study hours lead to better grades.
 - Good attendance improves performance.
 - Previous grades influence final results.
 - Parental support helps students succeed.

-Real-life use:
 This project can be used in real life:

. Colleges can identify weak students early
. Teachers can help students who need support
. Schools can imporve results using data
