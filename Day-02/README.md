. Dataset Description:
  This dataset contains information about customers such as usage frequency, support calls, subscription type, payment delay, and contract length.

. Type of Data:
  Structured (Table Data)

. ML Concept:
  Machine Learning :– predicting whether a customer will leave or stay.

. Problem Statement:
  Can we predict customer churn based on their usage behavior and service details?

. Prediction / Output:
  Customer will churn (leave) or not churn (stay).       
  
                                                   Eg:-     Input ->  Usage = Low                  Output ->  Customer will leave 
                                                                      Support Calls = High
                                                                      Payment Delay = Yes

. What we learned:
   - Customers with high support calls are more likely to leave.
   - Customers with frequent payment delays have higher churn risk.
   - Long-term contracts reduce churn.
   - Low usage customers are more likely to churn.

. Used by companies to identify customers who may leave and take actions to retain them.

. Real-life use:
