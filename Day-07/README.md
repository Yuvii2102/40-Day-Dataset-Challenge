* Dataset Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anishdevedward/loan-approval-dataset

* Dataset Description
   - This dataset contains information about loan applicants such as their income, credit score, employment details, and requested loan amount.

* Type of Data
 
  -  Structured data (tabular format)
     (rows & columns)

* ML Concept
   Machine Learning – Classification
  (Binary outcome: Approved / Not Approved)

* Problem Statement
  Can we predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on applicant details?

* Input Features

  - Annual Income
  
  - Credit Score

  - Loan Amount

  - Years Employed

  - Risk Points / Score

  - City (optional)

* Output
  Loan Approved → Yes / No (True / False)

* Correlation (IMPORTANT – tell mam/interviewer)

  - Higher credit score → higher chance of loan approval
  
  - Higher income → higher approval rate
  
  - Higher loan amount with low income → rejection chance increases
  
  - More years employed → better trust → approval increases

  👉 This shows how different factors are related to loan approval.


* Visualization (Power BI / Tableau)

  You can create:
  
  - Bar chart: Credit Score vs Loan Approval
 
  - Pie chart: Approved vs Rejected loans
 
  - Histogram: Income distribution
 
  - Column chart: Years employed vs Approval
 
👉 Visualization helps understand patterns easily.
