                                                 💰 Day 09 – Waiter Tips Prediction Dataset

📌 Dataset Description

This dataset contains restaurant billing and customer behavior information used to predict the tip amount given to waiters. It includes bill value, customer characteristics, time of visit, and group size.

---

📊 Type of Data

Structured data (restaurant transaction dataset)

---

🤖 ML Concept

Machine Learning – Regression
Predicting numeric output (tip amount).

---

❓ Problem Statement

Can we predict how much tip a waiter will receive based on the bill amount and customer behavior?

---

📥 Input

- Total bill amount
- Gender of customer
- Smoker / non-smoker
- Day of visit
