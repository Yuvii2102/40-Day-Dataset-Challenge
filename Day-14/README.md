About Dataset
This dataset contains financial and demographic information on 1,000 loan applicants, designed to facilitate the development of machine learning models for credit risk assessment and loan approval prediction. It includes key features such as annual income, credit score, loan amount, number of dependents, and employment status. The target variable, loan_approved, indicates whether a loan was granted (1) or denied (0). This dataset is ideal for practicing binary classification, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) within the banking and finance domain.
