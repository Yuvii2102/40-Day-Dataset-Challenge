📌 Dataset Description

This dataset contains information about university students, including their academic performance and daily habits.  

It helps us predict a student's Final CGPA based on attendance, study habits, sleep patterns, and lifestyle activities.

The dataset contains:
- 5,000 student records  
- 10 academic and lifestyle features  
- Clean and structured data (no missing values)

❓ Problem Statement

Can we predict a student's Final CGPA using:

- Attendance percentage  
- Study hours  
- Sleep hours  
- Social media usage  
- Screen time  
- Gaming hours  
- Previous CGPA
