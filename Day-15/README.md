About Dataset
Content
This dataset contains daily records of gym member attendance along with details of their workout activities. It includes information such as visit dates, types of exercises performed, workout duration, and related fitness actions logged during each visit. The data captures routine gym behavior at an individual level over a period of time.

Context
The dataset is useful for analyzing fitness patterns, member engagement, workout preferences, and attendance trends in a gym environment. It can help in understanding how often members visit, which exercises are most common, and how workout habits change over time—supporting insights for fitness tracking, gym management, and health analytics.
