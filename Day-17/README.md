📌 Dataset Description

This dataset models metabolic and lifestyle health indicators associated with diabetes risk.

Each row represents an individual and includes physiological measurements, lifestyle habits, and hereditary factors that influence diabetes development.

The dataset provides both:

- Diabetes Risk Score (0–100)
- Diabetes Risk Category (Low / Prediabetes / High Risk)

All data is synthetic and created for educational and machine learning practice.

📊 Type of Data

Structured tabular dataset  
Contains numerical and categorical features.

🤖 ML Concept

Machine Learning – Classification & Regression

- Classification → Predict diabetes risk category  
- Regression → Predict diabetes risk score  

---

🎯 Target Variables

🧠 What We Learned

- High BMI increases diabetes risk  
- High fasting glucose strongly predicts diabetes  
- Family history increases risk probability  
- Poor physical activity contributes to higher risk  
- High sugar intake and poor sleep increase metabolic risk
