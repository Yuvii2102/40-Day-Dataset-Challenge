📌 Dataset Description

This dataset contains 600 simulated match-level records for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026.

Each row represents a single T20 match and includes realistic features such as:

- ICC team rankings  
- Recent team form  
- Head-to-head history  
- Pitch conditions  
- Toss results  
- Venue home advantage  
- Simulated match winner  

The dataset is synthetic and created for machine learning and sports analytics practice.
