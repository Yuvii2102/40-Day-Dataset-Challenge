📌 Dataset Description

This dataset helps predict whether a person may have COVID-19 based on symptoms.

Symptoms are based on:

- WHO guidelines  
- Health ministry standards  

⚠ This is for learning purpose only. Not medical advice.

📊 Type of Data

Structured dataset  
Binary values (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  

Large dataset (3 lakh+ combinations)

---

🤖 ML Concept

Machine Learning – Classification  

We predict:

- COVID Positive  
- COVID Negative  

---

🎯 Target

Coronavirus Result (Yes / No)
